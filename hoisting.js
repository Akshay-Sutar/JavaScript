// functions can be used before they ar declares. JS puts the function defination during compilation. But if a variable is used before declaration, syntax error is thrown.

// strict mode
is activated by writing 'use strict'; before any other line.
works on entire script/function. doesnt work on block{}

changes are-
1. Eliminates some js silent error by changing them to throw error.
2. Fixes mistakes that makes it harder for js engines to optimize them.
3. prohibits some syntax that is likely to be defined in future ecmascript
